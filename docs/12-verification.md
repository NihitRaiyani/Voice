# Verification and acceptance evidence

The [baseline report](roadmaps/level-00-baseline.md) records fresh checks for this `Voice_Agent` checkout: **1,571 tests passed**, including disposable PostgreSQL/Redis integrations, and **10/10 offline evaluations** with zero findings. Lint has five existing import-format findings; do not report a clean all-checks baseline.

Tests needed explicit tokenizer data and permission for disposable local database shared memory. Passing after those setup corrections does not prove clean-machine reproduction, local-model quality, live latency or production readiness. Level 0 remains pending prerequisite review, reproducible setup and representative P50/P95 timing.

## Commands and environment

```bash
uv run --no-sync pytest -q
uv run --no-sync ruff check roma tests scripts
uv run --no-sync python scripts/run_eval.py
```

Use the locked telephony/dev/workers environment, NLTK sentence data and disposable PostgreSQL/Redis prerequisites in the [runbook](runbook.md). Report skips/errors explicitly. Existing async tests use `asyncio.run`; dial tests pin the clock/window. No paid AI or carrier calls occur by default.

## Evidence rules

Each level records revision, environment/data/model/prompt/document identity, reproducible command, actual outcome, demo/review and limitations. Distinguish source presence, offline verification, real local inference, authorized live verification and full gate pass. Reused foundations close individual checks, not whole levels automatically.

| Gate | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| L1 | Empty DB migrations, native startup, provider contracts/mocks, versioned API, reviewed pool budget and green CI |
| L2/L3 | Durable text restore, actual local inference/safety audit, committed live booking, 100-attempt race and cancellation/idempotency |
| L4–6 | Approved language/noise WER/CER/RTF, TTS intelligibility/first audio and complete local voice lab |
| L7 | Barge-in/double cancellation, late results/disconnect, Redis/provider loss, bounded pressure and event-loop lag |
| L8 | Roles/token lifecycle, forged/stale/duplicate callback policy, job crash/replay/retention and PII/access approvals |
| L9 | Eligible scoped/versioned evidence, local embeddings, golden Recall@K/MRR, grounding/deferral and final safety |
| L10 | Authorized local-model carrier call, serving/readiness/GPU admission, retrieval cancellation and zero external GenAI traffic |
| L11/L12 | Real telemetry/reconciled analytics, mock versus GPU capacity, chaos/security/golden regressions and measured SLOs |
| L13 | Clean-host startup/migrations/readiness, backup/restore and compatible rollback |

## Benchmark and documentation checks

Record sample count, hardware/concurrency, codec/noise/language mix, approved dataset, policy/model/document versions and warm/cold state. Measure user-stop-to-first-audio directly and report relevant P50/P95/P99, failures/fallbacks/queue wait/resource saturation. Do not add stage percentiles or promise roadmap example SLOs.

Documentation maintenance checks links/fences, stale carrier/package/roadmap references, level/status consistency, unchanged runtime/config/prompt assets and original Word-file identity. Inspect the diff and preserve pre-existing user edits. Full offline tests above are recorded baseline evidence; future documentation edits do not require paid/live checks.
